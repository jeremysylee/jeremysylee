### Hello, I'm Jeremy! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer currently working to help educate the next generation of software engineers.
I started with legos and now I use code. I love to debug and I strive to write organized, clean, scalable, and readable code. 
When I'm not coding, I'm probably surfing, spearfishing, or playing with my dogs.

```javascript
const tools = {
  frontend: ['Javascript', 'React/Redux', 'jQuery', 'HTML', 'CSS', 'styled-components'],
  backend: ['Node', 'Express', 'MySQL', 'PostgreSQL', 'mongoDB', 'Jest'],
  deployment: ['Docker', 'AWS(EC2, S3, RDS)', 'Nginx'],
}
```
